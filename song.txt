Empty spaces - what are we living for
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for

Another hero another mindless crime
Behind the curtain in the pantomime
Hold the line, 
does anybody want to take it anymore

The show must go on,
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on.

But my smile still stays on.
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
